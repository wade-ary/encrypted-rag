Key drugs include cocaine, particularly from Latin America, and captagon tablets from Syria and Lebanon. Criminal networks demonstrate adaptability, with crack cocaine gaining prominence in European consumer markets. Seizures of large quantities of cocaine have increased yearly since 2017, with Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain reporting the highest volumes. Globalization facilitates this complex criminal enterprise, with cross-border collaboration creating a fluid and networked environment. The Balkan route is a critical pathway for trafficking opiates and methamphetamine.",
